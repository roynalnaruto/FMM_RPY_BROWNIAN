=== TO BUILD 

step 1. Install required packages (see below) and define the following
   environment variables
   PETSC_DIR   (bash : export PETSC_DIR=/petsc_directory)
   DENDRO_DIR
   FFTW_DIR
	 MPI_DIR

	 if you use GPU, you also need CUDA 3 and the forloowing environment
   variables
   CUDA_DIR
   CUDA_SDK_DIR

step 2.  Copy one of makefile.{mpi,mpi_with_openmp,cuda} to makefile.this_machine
		    and modify the compiler flags if necessary.

step 3. Type "make ACTION=all tree"  in current directory. 
   (you can use "make ACTION=all clean" to clean up)

=== TO RUN THE EXAMPLES

step 1: cd examples
step 2: make
step 3. run:
 	 export OMP_NUM_THREADS=2;
   mpirun -np 2 ex0 
   mpirun -np 2 ex1
   mpirun -np 2 ex2
   mpirun -np 2 ex3  etc.

(you can use "make clean" to remove object files and executables)

ex0 : evaluates the Laplace potential
ex1 : evaluates the Laplace potential and its derivatives
ex2 : evaluates the Laplace potential on points that are not in the unit cube.
     (Currently, the tree construction REQUIRES that all input points
		 are in the unit cube.)
  

=== REQUIRED PACKAGES


- BLAS, LAPACK (see PETSc installation instructions at PETSc's web page)

- MPI (see PETSc installation instructions)

- PETSC-3.0.0
  http://ftp.mcs.anl.gov/pub/petsc/software_old/petsc-3.0.0-p12.tar.gz
	should compile with cxx, reals, and mpi.
  example of building PETSC:
  > cd $PETSC_DIR
	> configure  --with-clanguage=c++ --with-scalar-type=real \
             --with-blas-lapack-dir=/opt/intel/Compiler/11.1/059/mkl \
             --with-mpi-dir=/opt/openmpi-1.3.3 --with-shared=0
  > make


- fftw-3
  http://www.fftw.org/fftw-3.2.2.tar.gz

- CUDA: compatible with version 3. 
	    see examples/options on how to use the CUDA acceleration

- DENDRO-3.0.1 
	http://padas.ices.utexas.edu/static/dendro/releases/dendro-3.0.1.tgz
	Quick instructions for Dendro, assuming PETSC has been installed and PETSC_DIR is set.
 
  tar xzf dendro-3.0.1.tgz
	cd Dendro-3.0.1
	export DENDRO_DIR=$PWD
	make all
