pKIFMM 
Parallel Kernel Independent Fast Multipole Method.


This package implements a parallel fast multipole method and supports
multiple kernels (Laplace, Stokes, Navier, modified Laplacian). It
supports OpenMP, MPI, and GPU-acceleration.

see  INSTALL for installation instructions.
see examples/*.cpp and examples/README for usage examples.

RELEASE NOTES

* Currently, all source and target points must be contained in
  the unit cube.  See examples/ex2.cpp for a workaround.

* See ../fmm3d_mpi/kernel3d_mpi.hpp for supported kernels
