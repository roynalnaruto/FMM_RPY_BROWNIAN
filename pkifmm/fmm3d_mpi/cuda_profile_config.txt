# timestamp        # Time stamps for kernel launches and memory transfers.
                 # This can be used for timeline analysis.

gridsize         # Number of blocks in a grid along the X and Y dimensions for 
                 # a kernel launch          

threadblocksize  # Number of threads in a block along the X, Y and Z dimensions 
                 # for a kernel launch

# dynsmemperblock  # Size of dynamically allocated shared memory per block in bytes
                 # for a kernel launch

stasmemperblock  # Size of statically allocated shared memory per block in bytes
                 # for a kernel launch

regperthread     # Number of registers used per thread for a kernel launch.

# memtransferdir   # Memory transfer direction, a direction value of 0 is used for 
                 # host->device memory copies and a value of 1 is used for device->host
                 # memory copies.                  

# memtransfersize  # Memory copy size in bytes

# streamid         # Stream Id for a kernel launch


# The profiler supports logging of following counters during kernel execution:

gld_incoherent   # Non-coalesced (incoherent) global memory loads

# gld_coherent     # Coalesced (coherent) global memory loads

gst_incoherent   # Non-coalesced (incoherent) global memory stores

# gst_coherent     # Coalesced (coherent) global memory stores

# local_load       # Local memory loads

# local_store      # Local memory stores
# 
# branch           # Branches taken by threads executing a kernel.
# 
# divergent_branch # Divergent branches taken by threads executing a kernel.
# 
# instructions     # Instructions executed

warp_serialize   # Number of thread warps that serialize on address conflicts 
                 # to either shared or constant memory

cta_launched     # Number of threads blocks executed
